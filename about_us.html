			<div class="subtag"> About Us </div>
			<p>  Our goal is to promote vegetarianism by familiarizing people with 
			rare known benefits of vegetarianism along with the health risks of meat eating 
			all for the sake of animal rights.	Major reasons for people not being able to 
			support the animal right ideas and abstain from meat eating are health factors 
			and question such as 'Where would I get my proteins from?' or 'Does vegetarian food 
			only consist of salads?' All such questions shall be answered here in an effort 
			to promote animal rights movement. </p>

			<p>'Animal Rights' is one of the major reasons for people of various age groups to repulse 
			meat. Animal rights activists mostly have hunting, harvesting, factory farming, 
			experimentation-testing of animals on their list but 'Slaughtering Animals' </p>

			<p> Our mission is to make people aware of benefits of vegetarianism. So that their 
			transition from a meat-eater to vegetarian becomes smoother and anxiety-free.</p>
