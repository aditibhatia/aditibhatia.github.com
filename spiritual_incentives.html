			<p>&ldquo;The most important part of vegetarianism is the real shift in consciousness 
			that takes place. There is a true correlation between our food choices and violence
			in the world. The only person who would disagree with that is a meat-eater. &rdquo; <br/>
		- Peter Burwash, Davis Cup Winner.</p>


			<p>&ldquo;I do not eat meat because meat brings out negative qualities such as fear, anger, 
			anxiety, aggressiveness, etc. Vegetables peacefully offer themselves to the earth 
			when ripe, thus allowing a sublime and peaceful thought-consciousness&rdquo;<br/> - Carlos Santana, Musician.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Vegetarianism preserves live, health, peace, the ecology, 
			creates a more equitable distribution of resources, helps to feed 
			the hungry, encourages nonviolence for the animal and human members of 
			the planet, and is a powerful aid for the spiritual transformation of
			the body, emotions, mind, and spirit.&rdquo;<br/>- GABRIEL COUSENS, Conscious Eating</p>


			<p>&ldquo;The time will come when men such as I will look upon the murder of animals 
			as they now look on the murder of men&rdquo;<br/> - Leonardo da Vinci </p>

			<p>&ldquo;I do feel that spiritual progress does demand, at some stage, that we should 
			cease to kill our fellow creatures for the satisfaction of our bodily wants&rdquo;<br/> - Mahatma Gandhi </p>
