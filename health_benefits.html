			<p> Vegetarians are protected from various health risks because of their diet practice, 
			that meat eaters often have to face.</p>
			<p> Large scale studies have shown vegetarianism to significantly lower the risks 
			of heart diseases, the fat and cholesterol in meat boost the amount of cholesterol
			in consumers' blood, which leads to heart attacks. </p>
			<p> Cancer, obesity, hypertension, high blood pressure and diabetes 
			are also more common amongst meat-eaters than vegetarians. 
			Also, mercury traces in fish, mad cow disease, 
			bird flu and swine flu, are the nightmares for meat-eaters which could apparently 
			attack anyone of them anytime like a monster, whether unheard of before or known. </p>
			<p>Additionally, the women who eat meat on a daily basis are almost 4 times more likely
			to get breast cancer than those women who eat little or no meat. Besides all, 
			vegetarian diet is hormone-free. </p>
